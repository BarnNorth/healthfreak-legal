    <h2>1. Educational Purpose - Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>This application is designed exclusively for educational purposes. The information provided about ingredients is based on general research and educational opinions, not medical or health advice. We make no medical claims or recommendations.</p>
    
    <p>The ingredient classifications and information provided by this app are NOT medical advice, health advice, or nutritional guidance.

    <h2>2. Classification Meanings</h2>
    <p>Our ingredient classifications are educational opinions only. In the app interface, we display simplified labels "Clean" and "Toxic" for clarity. These correspond to our full classifications: "Clean" means "Generally Clean" (ingredients widely accepted as safe), and "Toxic" means "Potentially Toxic" (ingredients that may have concerns based on research). Neither classification represents definitive health claims, and individual responses to ingredients may vary.</p>
